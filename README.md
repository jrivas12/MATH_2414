# Diverging the Partial Sums of Two Men of Calculus: Encryptic Frontier

📘 A mathematical and ethical investigation into decryption complexity, password entropy, and the proactive defense of vulnerable populations through the lens of Calculus II.  
This project represents both an academic paper and supporting code designed to simulate and model attacker behavior using infinite series, recurrence relations, and entropy decay.
